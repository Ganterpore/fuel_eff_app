# Fuel Efficiency Tracking
*Note this app is still in beta and is unfinished* <br/>
This app is designed to record the fuel usage of a users car by getting them to add an entry whenever they fill up their car. Users can then use this information to track how much they are spending on fuel, and to determine how to reduce this.
All data is stored locally to the device, however it is backed up to the cloud.

# How to use the app
When you open the app you will be greeted with a screen showing the total historic details of the currently selected car. If you tap the history button you will be able to view all the times you have filled up your car, or tap the trips button on that page to get the history of your trips between refueling. By tapping the Data button you can look at different plots of various factors which can be gleaned from the data.Tapping on the currently selected car will allow you to change which car you are viewing.

## Adding an Entry
When you fuel up your car, you need to press the plus button in the bottom right of the screen. Here you can fill in the basic details of your trip.

After hitting next you get to a page where you can add tags about the previous trip you just had, such as whether it was through traffic or a long straight road, or if it was in warm days or cooler ones. These tags can later be used to analyze what affects your fuel consumption.

The next page is for filling in details that may affect your upcoming trip, perhaps which fuel station you just filled up at.

On the final page you can add any notes to this entry, this is just for your own information.
